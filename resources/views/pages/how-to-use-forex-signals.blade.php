	                    The main objective of this PDF is helping you maximize your profits by learning how to start from scratch, manage Take Profits, risk, leverage, and other key factors. It is  not our intention to explain deeply what the forex market is, which fundamental  factors affect changes in exchange rates, or any other aspect that is not 100% relevant  when it comes to successfully following our signals. We will, however, start with a short introduction for you to follow everything we explain.

	                <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold my-5">What is a PIP?</h3>

	                <p class="text-base leading-8 my-5">
	                    You need to understand what a PIP is and how to calculate its value to  understand what you are trading. PIP stands for Percentage in Point, and it is the  minimum price change that a specific exchange rate can make. An increase or  decrease in PIPS represents a gain or a loss in your trade. 
	                </p>

	                <p class="text-base leading-8 my-5">
	                	Usually, currencies are quoted to the fourth decimal place (for example:  EUR/USD 1.1103). There are exceptions, like the pairs that include the Japanese Yen  (JPY), or some commodities such as gold or oil. These are only quoted to the second  decimal place (for example: USD/JPY 107.98). 
	                </p>

	                <p class="text-base leading-8 my-5">
	                	When, for example, the EUR/USD pair moves from 1.1103 to 1.1104, it has  moved one PIP, because the fourth decimal place has increased by 1. For the USD/JPY,  a 1 PIP increase would be the following: from 107.98 to 107.99, because the second  decimal place has increased by one. 
	                </p>

	                <p class="text-base leading-8 my-5">
	                	Now that you know what a PIP is, we can use this concept in two real examples.  Each of them will take as reference the pairs of the previous paragraph so that you can  see the calculation with the two modalities (fourth and second decimal):

                		We have made these examples using huge amounts of money (100,000€ or  50,000$). These are very large figures, especially if you are new in trading. Here is  where a very important factor comes in: leverage, which basically allows you to trade  larger amounts than your initial investment.

				    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold my-5">What is leverage?</h3>


				    <p class="text-base leading-8 my-5">
				    	Imagine you want to buy a 100,000$ house, so you go to the bank to take out a loan.  The bank requires you to supply 20% of the value of the property as a down payment on the  loan. The result is that, for 20,000$, you can access a property valued in 100,000$. This is an  example of leverage in real estate. You have bought the house at a leverage of 5x (20,000 is 1/5  of 100,000).
                	</p>

                	<p class="text-base leading-8 my-5">
                		One year later, the real estate market has appreciated by 10%, so your house is now  valued at 110,000$ and you decide to sell it. If you had not asked for a loan and you had paid for  the entire house from the beginning (100,000$), your profits of your initial investment would  effectively be 10% (10,000$). However, the fact that you only invested 20,000$ and used the  leverage, means that those 10,000$ of house appreciation no longer represent only 10% of your investment, but you will have made a much more profitable operation that will have given you  a return of 50% (10,000$ profits with an investment of 20,000$, which coincides with the result  of multiplying the theoretical profits-10% by your leverage-5x).
                	</p>

                	<p class="text-base leading-8 my-5">
                		Now, let’s apply this logic to a crypto trade. Imagine you buy BTC at 30,000$ with TP1 at  30,200$, and leverage is 10x. If you wouldn’t have had leverage and it hits TP1, the % profit you  take is (30,200/30,000)*100 = 0.66%. However, with leverage, you multiply that % by 10, so your  total profit when it hits TP1 is 6.66% of your initial amount.

                	<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold my-5">So, how much leverage should you use?</h3>

                	<p class="text-base leading-8 my-5">
                		Managing risk is key in forex trading, especially when you are new, so you  must be very careful when choosing how much leverage you are going to use. It  depends on many factors, one of which is the amount of money you are going to  invest. In Matatrader 4 you choose how big is your leverage by choosing your lot. A lot  in forex represents the quantity of the currency bought or sold in one trade. So, the  size of a trade is measured in lots. 
                	</p>

                	<p class="text-base leading-8 my-5">
                		The standard lot in forex is = 100,000 units. Therefore, if you invest 1,000€ and open a  buying trade in the pair EUR/USD with lot size 1, you are buying 100,000€, so you´re  buying at a leverage of 100x. 
                	</p>

                	<h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-4">These are the lot sizes we recommend depending on how much you invest:</h3>

                	<p class="text-base leading-8 my-5">
                		The management of Take Profits depends on the level of risk you want to  assume and the amount of money you have invested in your account. There are  different ways in which you can manage this:

                	<h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-4">Strategy 1</h3>


                	<p class="text-base leading-8 my-5">
                		Metatrader 4 does not let you open 1 trade with more than 1 TP, so you should  open 3 different trades in the following way:

                            One trade setting the TP1 with 70% of your lot. Therefore, if you are using lot  0.1, this trade should have lot 0.07

                            Another trade setting the TP2 with 20% of your lot (which would be 0.02) – A third trade setting the TP3 with the pending 10% of your lot (0.01)
                        </li>
                    </ul>


                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-4">Advantage of using this strategy:</h3>

                            Trades will close automatically when they hit the TPs, meaning you will not  have to be so alert to the market’s movements. This will lower the risk, which is  perfect for those who are starting to trade

                            Less risk means also fewer potential gains. The fact that trades close  automatically limits your potential gains

                            If your initial investment is low (100$ or so), you will not be able to open more  than one trade, as the recommended lot is 0.01 and it is the minimum you can  open in MT4. You can either use lot 0.02 and open two trades (with the TPs of  your choice)
                        </li>

                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-4">Strategy 2</h3>

                    <p class="text-base leading-8 my-5">
                		This option consists of opening a single trade with no TPs, placing only the Stop  Loss. You will then have to be extremely alert to the market’s movements, so when the  trade hits TP1, you should close 70% of the trade, when it hits TP2, close 20%, and  when it hits TP3, close the pending 10%. You can, however, modify these percentages  depending on the risk you are willing to assume.
                	</p>

                	<p class="text-base leading-8 my-5">
                		For example, if you open a trade with lot 0.1, you will close 0.07 (70%) when it  hits TP1, leaving the pending operation with lot 0.03. You will then close 0.02 (20%)  when it touches TP2, leaving the pending operation with lot 0.01. Finally, you will close  the rest when it hits TP3.

                            You must be very alert to the markets, as the operations will not close  automatically. Therefore, this is a much riskier option, only recommended for  more experienced traders.

However, when your first trade has been closed (TP1  has been touched), you should move the SL to either the market execution  price (the price in which you opened the trade) or to TP1 price

                            A third trade setting the TP3 with the pending 10% of your lot and putting the  SL where we have said in the signal. You should move the SL to either the  market execution price or to TP1 price when your first trade has been closed,  and following the same logic, when the second trade has been closed, you  should move the SL to either TP1 price (if you had previously moved it to the  market execution price) or to TP2 price

                		The same logic applies to those who cannot open 3 trades because they use very small lots: if the price reaches TP1, move the SL to either the market execution  price or to TP1 price to secure profits and eliminate risk. Use the same method when it  reaches TP2.

                            Forex trading requires a high amount of patience and discipline. You should not  assess your results the same day you start. Wait some weeks as you learn how  to follow our signals and manage your funds correctly.

                            If your initial inversion is low, don’t assume huge risks to get bigger gains faster.

                            This is a mid/long-term thing, so don’t expect to go from 100 do 1000$ in one  week. Instead, be disciplined and constant, and remember that your gains will  compound little by little.
